This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP when dealing with sessions: not properly checking if a session variable is set before using it.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially if the user hasn't started a session or the session has timed out.

```php
<?php
// Assume we want to display a user's username from the session
echo "Welcome, " . $_SESSION['username'] . "!";
?>
```

The problem is that if `$_SESSION['username']` is not set, this will cause a notice or even a fatal error, depending on the PHP configuration.
